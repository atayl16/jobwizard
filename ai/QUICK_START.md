---

## ⚡ Start Using Now

### 1. Start the App

```bash
cd ~/Dev/JobWizard
bin/dev
```

→ Opens at: `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Manual Application Flow (Fastest)

1. Go to: `/applications/new`
2. Paste a job description
3. Click "Generate Application"
4. Download PDFs from the result page

**Output location:** `~/Documents/JobWizard/Applications/<Company>/<Role>/<Date>/`

### 3. Job Board Flow (Automated)

1. Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Check for New Jobs" (fetches from configured sources)
3. Browse jobs, click "Tailor & Export"
4. PDFs generated in same location

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Files (Already Present)

```
config/job_wizard/
├── profile.yml      # Your contact info, summary
├── experience.yml   # Skills with proficiency levels
├── rules.yml        # Red flags, blocklists
└── sources.yml      # Job board APIs (Greenhouse, Lever)
```

### Optional: OpenAI Integration

Add to `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

**Without OpenAI:** Uses template-based generation (works fine!)

### Output Path (Optional)

Default: `~/Documents/JobWizard/`

Override with:
```bash
export JOB_WIZARD_OUTPUT_ROOT=~/Desktop/Applications
```

---

## 🧪 Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Run tests
bundle exec rspec

# Check database
rails runner "puts JobPosting.count"

# Check config
rails runner "require 'job_wizard/yaml_validator'; puts 'Config OK' if JobWizard::YamlValidator.validate_all"
```

---

## 📝 Key Commands

```bash
# Start server
bin/dev

# Run tests
just test

# Linting (400+ style issues, not critical)
just lint

# Security scan
just sec
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to database"
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### "Missing config file"
Check `config/job_wizard/` has all 4 YAML files.

### "PDFs not saving"
Verify: `~/Documents/JobWizard/` exists and is writable.

### "Job fetch fails"
Check `sources.yml` has valid API endpoints.  
**Stubs OK for now** - manual flow works without fetchers.

---

## 🎯 Truth-Only Policy

**Critical:** This app NEVER fabricates skills or experience.

- All content sourced from YAML files
- Unverified skills flagged, not included
- Red-flag scanner warns about problematic requirements
- Resume builder rejects AI hallucinations

**To add skills:** Edit `config/job_wizard/experience.yml` manually.
