# üß† AI Diagnostic Recovery Prompt (for Cursor or Claude)

Use this anytime the AI repeats fixes or gets stuck in a bug loop.

---

## ‚õîÔ∏è Diagnostic Mode ‚Äî Stop and Think

**Stop editing code.**

We have a recurring bug or incomplete fix.
Before attempting another patch, switch to **diagnostic-only mode**.

Perform the following steps:

### 1. Trace the data flow
Identify where the problematic value or behavior enters the codebase.  
Show the full call path: `source ‚Üí model ‚Üí controller ‚Üí view ‚Üí output`.

**Example:**
```
API Response (Greenhouse/Lever)
  ‚Üì
Fetcher (normalize_jobs ‚Üí extract_description)
  ‚Üì
Database (job_postings.description column)
  ‚Üì
Model (JobPosting)
  ‚Üì
Controller (JobsController#show)
  ‚Üì
View (jobs/show.html.erb)
  ‚Üì
Browser Output
```

### 2. Prove contamination point
Show 1‚Äì2 lines of code or console output proving *where* the bad value appears.

**Example:**
```ruby
# In rails console:
job = JobPosting.find(1526)
job.description[0..100]
# => "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;..."
# ‚ùå HTML entities are already in the database
```

### 3. Classify the failure
Choose one:
- **Logic bug** (bad branch or nil)
- **Data contamination** (HTML, encoding, etc.)
- **Lifecycle error** (wrong callback order)
- **Config/environment mismatch**
- **Test vs production inconsistency**

### 4. Propose exactly ONE fix location
Choose the single best place to fix it (e.g., Fetcher, Model callback, View helper).  
Explain *why* this is the correct layer for the fix.

**Example:**
```
Fix location: app/services/job_wizard/fetchers/greenhouse.rb (line 45-49)
Method: extract_description

Why:
1. Clean data at ingestion (single source of truth)
2. Database stores clean data (easier to debug/query)
3. Fix once during fetch (rare), not every render (frequent)
4. All downstream consumers get clean data automatically
5. Resume/cover letter builders benefit without separate fixes
```

### 5. Do not apply changes yet
Wait for human confirmation before showing diffs.

---

## ‚úÖ Once Approved

After approval, apply the fix *only* in the file and method identified above.  
Show diffs and add a minimal test proving the bug no longer occurs.

**Post-fix verification:**
1. Re-fetch a job posting from the external API
2. Verify the database contains clean text (no HTML entities)
3. Verify the view renders clean text
4. Optionally: Add a spec testing the cleaning logic

---

## üß™ Example Use

> "Stop editing. We're seeing job descriptions render with HTML tags.  
> Diagnose which layer introduces the HTML. Trace from Fetchers to View.  
> Then propose one permanent fix location, no edits yet."

---

## üí¨ Quick Use Command

You can quickly trigger this prompt inside Cursor by typing:

```
/diagnose [brief description of the bug]
```

Or simply paste this into your Cursor chat:

```
Stop editing code. Switch to diagnostic mode.
Trace the data flow for [ISSUE], prove where the bad data appears,
classify the bug type, and propose ONE fix location.
Do not apply changes yet.
```

---

## üß∞ Recommended Shell Alias

If you maintain a shell function or Justfile for AI actions, add this alias:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
ai_diagnose() {
  cat ai/prompts/diagnostic_prompt.md
}
```

Then run:
```bash
$ ai_diagnose
```

---

## üìö When to Use This

Use diagnostic mode when you notice:
- ‚úÖ The same fix is attempted 3+ times
- ‚úÖ Multiple layers are being modified without clear improvement
- ‚úÖ The AI says "now it should work" but the bug persists
- ‚úÖ You're unsure which layer is causing the issue
- ‚úÖ Previous attempts modified the wrong part of the codebase

**Don't use for:**
- ‚ùå Simple syntax errors (just fix them)
- ‚ùå Clear, well-understood bugs with obvious fixes
- ‚ùå New features (use regular prompts)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

A good diagnostic response includes:
1. ‚úÖ Complete data flow diagram
2. ‚úÖ Console/log output proving contamination point
3. ‚úÖ Bug classification
4. ‚úÖ Single fix location with justification
5. ‚úÖ No code changes (yet)

If the AI starts showing diffs immediately, remind it:
> "Stop. Diagnostic mode means no code changes. Just analyze and propose."

## üìù Template for AI Response

```
## Diagnostic Analysis

### Data Flow
[Show path from source to output]

### Contamination Point
[Show proof with code/console output]

### Bug Classification
[Pick one: Logic / Data / Lifecycle / Config / Test inconsistency]

### Recommended Fix Location
File: [exact file path]
Method: [exact method name]
Line: [line number range]

Justification:
1. [Reason 1]
2. [Reason 2]
3. [Reason 3]

### Waiting for approval before applying changes.
```

## üîÑ After Fix is Applied

Create a smoke test to prevent regression:

```bash
# Example smoke test
rails runner "
  job = JobPosting.last
  if job.description.include?('&lt;') || job.description.include?('&gt;')
    puts '‚ùå HTML entities still present'
    exit 1
  else
    puts '‚úÖ Clean text confirmed'
  end
"
```
