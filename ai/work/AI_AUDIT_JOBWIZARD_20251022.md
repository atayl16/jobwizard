# AI Audit: JobWizard
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Auditor**: AI Senior Rails Auditor  
**Repository**: JobWizard - Local-only Job Board & R√©sum√© Tailoring Tool

---

## üß≠ Summary

JobWizard is a Rails 8 application designed exclusively for local use on macOS. It fetches job postings from Greenhouse and Lever APIs, filters for Ruby/Rails roles, and generates truth-only r√©sum√© and cover letter PDFs using user-defined YAML configuration files. The app includes sophisticated filtering (company blocklists, content filtering, security clearance detection), skill assessment per job, and comprehensive job status management.

**Current State**: The codebase is well-structured with solid Rails conventions, comprehensive services layer, and growing test coverage. Recent additions include filtering/rules engine, per-job skill assessments, and HTML sanitization. The app successfully balances feature richness with maintainability, though there are opportunities for refinement given its local-only nature.

**Key Observations**:
- **Strengths**: Clean service objects, truth-only PDF generation, comprehensive filtering system, good separation of concerns
- **Opportunities**: Database migration issue (UUID on SQLite), redundant async job complexity for local use, potential for better local file management, some test gaps
- **Local-First Win**: The constraint of being local-only opens up simplification opportunities (synchronous processing, direct file access, no auth needed)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Quality

### Maintainability & DRYness

**‚úÖ Strengths:**
1. **Service Objects**: Excellent use of service objects in `app/services/job_wizard/`. Each has a clear, single responsibility (e.g., `HtmlCleaner`, `RulesEngine`, `EffectiveSkillsService`).
2. **Consistent Naming**: Controllers, models, and services follow Rails conventions consistently.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: PDF generation, rules scanning, and skill detection are properly isolated.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Duplicate PDF Generation Code** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - `ApplicationsController#generate_pdfs` (lines 262-286)
   - `ApplicationsController#generate_pdfs_with_skills` (lines 233-260)
   - `JobsController#tailor` (lines 43-62)
   - `GeneratePdfsJob#perform` (lines 24-41)
   
   **Impact**: ~80 lines of duplication across 4 locations
   
   **Recommendation**: Extract to `JobWizard::ApplicationPdfGenerator` service:
   ```ruby
   class JobWizard::ApplicationPdfGenerator
     def initialize(application, allowed_skills: nil, job_posting: nil)
       @application = application
       @allowed_skills = allowed_skills
       @job_posting = job_posting
     end
     
     def generate!
       builder = JobWizard::ResumeBuilder.new(
         job_description: @application.job_description,
         allowed_skills: @allowed_skills,
         job_posting: @job_posting
       )
       manager = JobWizard::PdfOutputManager.new(
         company: @application.company,
         role: @application.role,
         timestamp: @application.created_at || Time.current
       )
       
       manager.ensure_directories!
       manager.write_resume(builder.build_resume)
       manager.write_cover_letter(builder.build_cover_letter)
       manager.update_latest_symlink!
       
       @application.update(output_path: manager.display_path, status: :generated)
     end
   end
   ```

2. **UUID Migration Issue** (CRITICAL BUG)
   - `db/migrate/20251021231000_create_job_skill_assessments.rb` uses `type: :uuid` but SQLite doesn't support UUID types
   - Current schema dump shows: `# Could not dump table "job_skill_assessments" because of following StandardError`
   - **Fix**: Change `t.references :job_posting, null: false, foreign_key: true, type: :uuid` to `t.integer :job_posting_id, null: false` in migration

3. **Skill Extraction Duplication** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - `JobsController#extract_skills_from_description` (lines 103-110) uses simple array matching
   - `ResumeBuilder#extract_skills_from_jd` (lines 135-150) uses comprehensive regex
   - **Recommendation**: Consolidate into `JobWizard::SkillDetector` (which already exists) and make it the single source of truth

4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some controllers rescue StandardError, others don't
   - Recommendation: Add `rescue_from` at ApplicationController level for consistent local error display

### Suggested Service Refactors

1. **Create `JobWizard::JobStatusManager`**
   - Consolidate job status transitions (mark_applied!, mark_exported!, ignore)
   - Add state machine validation (e.g., can't mark as applied if already exported)
   - Include audit trail for status changes

2. **Extract `JobWizard::FetchCoordinator`**
   - Currently `lib/tasks/jobs.rake` has complex fetch logic (~220 lines)
   - Move business logic out of rake task into service for testability
   - Rake task becomes thin wrapper calling `FetchCoordinator.run(provider, slug)`

3. **Create `JobWizard::SkillAssessmentManager`**
   - Consolidate skill extraction, assessment, and effective skills calculation
   - Single entry point for skill-related operations
   - Better caching of extracted skills per job

### Test Coverage Recommendations

**Current Coverage**: Good service test coverage, some model tests, minimal controller/integration tests

**Missing Tests** (by priority):
1. **Integration Tests for PDF Generation Flow** - No end-to-end test covering: fetch job ‚Üí tailor ‚Üí verify PDFs exist on disk
2. **Controller Tests for FiltersController** - Basic request specs exist but missing edge cases
3. **System Tests for Job Board Workflow** - Only one navigation spec exists
4. **Rules Engine Integration with Fetchers** - Tests for RulesEngine exist, but not integrated with actual fetchers
5. **Skill Assessment Workflow** - No test covering: view job ‚Üí assess skills ‚Üí generate PDF with those assessments

**Specific Test Files to Create**:
```
spec/integration/pdf_generation_flow_spec.rb  # End-to-end PDF generation
spec/integration/job_filtering_flow_spec.rb   # Fetch ‚Üí filter ‚Üí display
spec/system/job_application_workflow_spec.rb  # Full user workflow
spec/services/job_wizard/application_pdf_generator_spec.rb  # New service
spec/lib/tasks/jobs_rake_spec.rb  # Rake task behavior
```

### Code Smells to Address

1. **Long Parameter Lists**
   - `JobWizard::ResumeBuilder.new(job_description:, allowed_skills:, job_posting:)`
   - Consider using a parameter object or builder pattern

2. **Feature Envy**
   - `ApplicationsController` knows too much about `PdfOutputManager` and `ResumeBuilder` internals
   - Solution: Proposed `ApplicationPdfGenerator` service

3. **Primitive Obsession**
   - Skills represented as arrays of strings everywhere
   - Consider `Skill` value object with `name`, `verified`, `proficiency` attributes

4. **Magic Strings**
   - Status strings like 'suggested', 'applied', 'exported' used inconsistently
   - Fixed in models with enum, but still raw strings in some service code

## üß© Features & UX

### High-Impact Usability Features

1. **"Open in Finder" Button for Generated PDFs** (HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)
   - Currently user sees "output_path" as text
   - Add button that calls `open` command to reveal PDF folder
   - Uses existing `FilesController#reveal` pattern
   - **Implementation**:
     ```ruby
     # In applications/show.html.erb
     <%= button_to "Open PDFs in Finder", 
       files_reveal_path(path: @application.output_path), 
       method: :post, 
       class: "btn-primary" %>
     ```

2. **Job Board Bulk Actions** (HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)
   - Select multiple jobs and perform bulk actions (ignore, export all, block company)
   - Checkbox selection with "Select All" toggle
   - Action bar that appears when jobs are selected
   - Reduces repetitive clicking for managing many jobs

3. **PDF Preview Before Download** (MEDIUM IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)
   - Use PDF.js or browser native PDF viewing
   - Allows quick review before applying
   - Show side-by-side r√©sum√© and cover letter
   - **Alternative**: Markdown preview of content before PDF generation

4. **Smart Job Deduplication** (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)
   - Same job posted on multiple boards shows up multiple times
   - Add fuzzy matching on (company + title) with 90% similarity threshold
   - UI shows "Similar to X other jobs" with merge option

5. **Application Templates** (LOW IMPACT, HIGH VALUE)
   - Save different "profiles" (e.g., "Backend Heavy", "Full Stack", "Remote Only")
   - Each template has different skill emphasis, allowed_skills, company blocklists
   - Switch between templates when generating PDFs

6. **Job Notes & Tracking** (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)
   - Add `notes` text field to `job_postings` and `applications`
   - Track: application date, follow-up dates, interview stages, salary discussed
   - Converts JobWizard into mini applicant tracking system

### Low-Impact Quality-of-Life Improvements

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `j`/`k` for navigate jobs (Vim-style)
   - `t` for "Tailor & Export" selected job
   - `i` for ignore, `a` for mark applied
   - Use Stimulus controller for keyboard handling

2. **Dark Mode**
   - Add theme toggle (saves to localStorage)
   - Tailwind already supports dark mode classes
   - Minimal changes needed

3. **Job Count Badges**
   - Show counts in navigation: "Jobs (15)", "Blocked Companies (3)"
   - Updates live with Turbo Streams

4. **Recent Companies Quick Filter**
   - Sidebar showing recently seen companies
   - Click to filter jobs by company
   - Uses `JobPosting.group(:company).count`

5. **Export Applications to CSV**
   - Export all applications with metadata for external tracking
   - Headers: Company, Role, Applied Date, Status, PDF Path
   - One rake task: `rake jobs:export_csv`

6. **Syntax Highlighting for JD**
   - Highlight matched keywords (Ruby, Rails) in green
   - Highlight exclusion keywords (PHP, .NET) in red
   - Makes filtering logic visually obvious

### UI Polish Ideas

1. **Consistent Button Styles** (Partially Done)
   - Current: Mix of `button_to` and `link_to` with various Tailwind classes
   - Create helper methods:
     - `primary_button`, `secondary_button`, `danger_button`
     - Ensures consistency and easier redesign

2. **Loading States**
   - "Tailor & Export" shows spinner while generating PDFs
   - Use Turbo Frame with loading="lazy" attribute
   - Prevents duplicate clicks

3. **Empty States**
   - Better messaging when no jobs found
   - Show "No jobs match your filters" with suggestions
   - Onboarding for first-time use: "Add a job source first"

4. **Toast Notifications Instead of Flash**
   - Use Stimulus + Tailwind for slide-in toasts
   - Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
   - Stack multiple notifications

5. **Job Card Hover States**
   - Show quick actions on hover (Apply, Ignore, Block)
   - Reduce visual clutter when not hovering
   - Better use of screen real estate

6. **Settings Organization**
   - Current `/settings/filters` could expand to tabs:
     - Filters & Blocklist
     - Profile & Experience
     - PDF Preferences
     - Export Settings

## üß† Architecture & Performance

### Local-Only Simplifications

**Since this app NEVER deploys**, you can simplify significantly:

1. **Remove Solid Queue / Async Job Complexity** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Current: `GeneratePdfsJob` uses Solid Queue for async processing
   - **Reality**: PDF generation is ~200ms on local machine
   - **Recommendation**: Make PDF generation synchronous
   - **Benefits**:
     - Remove `solid_queue` gem dependency
     - Simpler error handling (no retry logic needed)
     - Instant feedback to user
     - One less background process running
   - **Implementation**: Just call `ApplicationPdfGenerator.new(...).generate!` directly

2. **Simplify File Storage** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Current: Both database `output_path` AND file-on-disk
   - **Recommendation**: Make filesystem the source of truth
   - **Pattern**:
     ```ruby
     class Application
       def pdf_directory
         PdfOutputManager.directory_for(company: company, role: role, timestamp: created_at)
       end
       
       def resume_path
         File.join(pdf_directory, 'resume.pdf')
       end
       
       def pdfs_ready?
         File.exist?(resume_path) && File.exist?(cover_letter_path)
       end
     end
     ```
   - **Benefit**: Eliminates sync issues between DB and filesystem

3. **Skip Solid Cache** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Current: Using `solid_cache` for Rails caching
   - **Local-only**: Memory store is simpler and faster
   - **Change**: `config/environments/development.rb` ‚Üí `config.cache_store = :memory_store`

4. **Remove Kamal/Thruster/Deployment Gems** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Current: Gemfile includes `kamal`, `thruster`, `Dockerfile`
   - **Recommendation**: Clean up unused deployment artifacts
   - **Benefit**: Faster `bundle install`, clearer intent

### SQLite Optimizations

**Current Setup**: Uses SQLite3, which is perfect for local-only

**Optimizations**:

1. **Enable WAL Mode** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   ```ruby
   # config/database.yml
   default: &default
     adapter: sqlite3
     pool: 5
     timeout: 5000
     journal_mode: wal  # Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrency
   ```

2. **Add Appropriate Indexes** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Current: Good index coverage
   - Missing: `index_applications_on_output_path` for path lookups
   - Missing: `index_job_postings_on_created_at` for recent job sorting

3. **Database Cleanup Automation** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Auto-run `rake jobs:clean` monthly via launchd (macOS cron alternative)
   - Or add to `whenever` gem (though adds dependency)

4. **Vacuum on Startup** (LOW IMPACT)
   ```ruby
   # config/initializers/sqlite_maintenance.rb
   Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
     ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute('PRAGMA optimize')
   end
   ```

### Performance Wins

1. **Memoize Expensive Calls** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - `RulesScanner.scan` called multiple times for same JD
   - Cache scan results on Application model: `memoize :scan_results`

2. **Eager Load Associations** (LOW IMPACT)
   - `JobPosting.includes(:job_skill_assessments)` in index
   - Prevents N+1 queries when showing skill counts

3. **Partial Caching for Job Cards** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Cache individual job card renders
   - Cache key: `[job, job.updated_at, job.status]`

---

## ü™Ñ AI & Automation

### YAML Validation

**Current State**: No validation of `profile.yml` or `experience.yml` on startup

**Recommendations**:

1. **JSON Schema Validation** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Create schema files: `config/job_wizard/schemas/profile.schema.json`
   - Validate on app boot and before PDF generation
   - Gem: `json-schema` or `dry-validation`
   - **Example**:
     ```ruby
     # app/services/job_wizard/yaml_validator.rb
     class JobWizard::YamlValidator
       def validate_profile!
         schema = JSON.parse(File.read(Rails.root.join('config/job_wizard/schemas/profile.schema.json')))
         data = YAML.safe_load_file(CONFIG_PATH.join('profile.yml'))
         JSON::Validator.validate!(schema, data)
       rescue JSON::Schema::ValidationError => e
         raise "Profile YAML invalid: #{e.message}"
       end
     end
     ```

2. **YAML Lint Task** (LOW IMPACT)
   ```ruby
   # lib/tasks/yaml.rake
   task :yaml_lint => :environment do
     JobWizard::YamlValidator.new.validate_all!
     puts "‚úì All YAML files valid"
   end
   ```

3. **Autocomplete for Skills in UI** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - When adding skills in `experience.yml`, show autocomplete
   - Source: Common tech skills list + already used skills
   - Prevents typos and inconsistency

### Prompt Chain Opportunities

**Current State**: Uses `WriterFactory` for cover letter generation

**Enhancements**:

1. **R√©sum√© Bullet Point QA** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - After generating r√©sum√©, run QA pass:
     - Check: All skills mentioned are in `experience.yml`
     - Check: No fabricated job titles or dates
     - Check: Proper grammar and consistency
   - Output: Warnings before finalizing PDF

2. **JD Analysis Pre-Summary** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Before fetching, analyze JD for:
     - Required vs. nice-to-have skills
     - Estimated salary range (if mentioned)
     - Remote/hybrid/onsite clarity
     - Team size indicators
   - Store in `job_postings.metadata` JSON field

3. **Cover Letter Tone Customization** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Add setting: "Tone" ‚Üí Formal | Conversational | Technical
   - Pass to `Writer` for adjusted generation
   - Store preference per company or globally

4. **Multi-Model Fallback** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Current: Single writer factory
   - Enhancement: Try GPT-4 first, fallback to Claude if error
   - Local-only benefit: No API rate limit concerns

### Automation Ideas

1. **Auto-Fetch on Schedule** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Create launchd plist to run `rake jobs:board` daily
   - Benefit: Always have fresh jobs without manual trigger
   - **Implementation**:
     ```xml
     <!-- ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jobwizard.fetch.plist -->
     <plist>
       <dict>
         <key>Label</key>
         <string>com.jobwizard.fetch</string>
         <key>ProgramArguments</key>
         <array>
           <string>/Users/USER/.rbenv/shims/rake</string>
           <string>jobs:board</string>
         </array>
         <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
         <dict>
           <key>Hour</key>
           <integer>9</integer>
         </dict>
       </dict>
     </plist>
     ```

2. **Smart Notification on New Jobs** (LOW IMPACT)
   - After fetch, if new Ruby/Rails jobs found, send macOS notification
   - Use `terminal-notifier` gem
   - **Example**: "5 new Rails jobs from Airbnb"

3. **Application Deadline Tracker** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Extract application deadlines from JDs (e.g., "Apply by Oct 30")
   - Store in `applications.deadline_at`
   - Show "Expiring Soon" badge on job cards

4. **Backup YAML Files to Git** (LOW IMPACT)
   - Auto-commit `config/job_wizard/*.yml` changes
   - Creates version history of your profile/experience
   - Script: `bin/yaml-backup`

---

## üîç Testing & Developer Experience

### Test Coverage Gaps

**Current Test Files** (from spec/):
- ‚úÖ Good: Service objects (RulesEngine, ExperienceLoader, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Good: Model validations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Request specs (missing FiltersController edge cases)
- ‚ùå Missing: Controller unit tests
- ‚ùå Missing: Integration/system tests
- ‚ùå Missing: Rake task tests

**Priority Test Coverage to Add**:

1. **End-to-End Workflows** (CRITICAL)
   ```ruby
   # spec/system/application_generation_spec.rb
   RSpec.describe 'Generating an application', type: :system do
     it 'creates PDFs and makes them accessible' do
       visit root_path
       fill_in 'Job Description', with: sample_jd
       click_button 'Generate PDFs'
       
       expect(page).to have_content('PDFs generated')
       expect(File.exist?(latest_resume_path)).to be true
       expect(File.exist?(latest_cover_letter_path)).to be true
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Controller Isolation Tests** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Test each controller action independently
   - Mock service calls to focus on controller logic
   - Verify correct params handling and redirects

3. **Service Integration Tests** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Test service collaborations (e.g., RulesEngine + Fetchers)
   - Verify RulesEngine correctly rejects jobs at fetch time

4. **Migration Rollback Tests** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Verify migrations are reversible
   - Test down migrations don't lose data

### RSpec Utilities

**Recommended Additions**:

1. **Shared Examples for PDF Generation**
   ```ruby
   # spec/support/shared_examples/pdf_generation.rb
   RSpec.shared_examples 'a PDF generator' do
     it 'creates resume.pdf' do
       subject.generate!
       expect(File.exist?(subject.resume_path)).to be true
     end
     
     it 'creates cover_letter.pdf' do
       subject.generate!
       expect(File.exist?(subject.cover_letter_path)).to be true
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Factory Traits for Common Scenarios**
   ```ruby
   # spec/factories/job_postings.rb
   FactoryBot.define do
     factory :job_posting do
       trait :remote do
         remote { true }
         location { 'Remote' }
       end
       
       trait :with_clearance do
         description { 'Requires active security clearance' }
       end
       
       trait :blocked do
         after(:create) do |job|
           BlockedCompany.create!(name: job.company, reason: 'test')
         end
       end
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Custom Matchers**
   ```ruby
   # spec/support/matchers/pdf_matchers.rb
   RSpec::Matchers.define :have_generated_pdfs do
     match do |application|
       application.pdfs_ready? &&
         File.exist?(application.resume_path) &&
         File.exist?(application.cover_letter_path)
     end
   end
   ```

### Justfile Enhancements

**Current Justfile**: Good coverage of basic tasks

**Recommended Additions**:

1. **Fast Feedback Loop**
   ```makefile
   # Run tests for recently changed files
   test-changed:
     git diff --name-only HEAD | grep _spec.rb | xargs bundle exec rspec
   
   # Run tests affected by service changes
   test-services:
     bundle exec rspec spec/services
   ```

2. **Database Tasks**
   ```makefile
   # Fresh database with sample data
   db-fresh:
     bin/rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
   
   # Restore from backup
   db-restore path:
     cp {{path}} storage/development.sqlite3
   ```

3. **Quality Checks**
   ```makefile
   # Run all checks before committing
   pre-commit: lint test yaml-lint
     echo "‚úì All checks passed"
   
   # Check for N+1 queries
   bullet:
     BULLET=true bin/rails server
   ```

4. **PDF Generation Testing**
   ```makefile
   # Generate test PDFs with sample data
   test-pdfs:
     bin/rails runner 'script/generate_test_pdfs.rb'
   
   # Open most recent PDF output
   open-latest:
     open ~/Documents/JobWizard/Applications/Latest/
   ```

### Local Safety Scripts

**Recommended Scripts**:

1. **YAML Validation** (`script/validate_yaml.rb`)
   ```ruby
   #!/usr/bin/env ruby
   require_relative '../config/environment'
   
   validator = JobWizard::YamlValidator.new
   
   begin
     validator.validate_profile!
     validator.validate_experience!
     validator.validate_rules!
     puts "‚úì All YAML files valid"
   rescue => e
     puts "‚úó YAML validation failed: #{e.message}"
     exit 1
   end
   ```

2. **Rules Verification** (`script/verify_rules.rb`)
   ```ruby
   # Test all filtering rules against sample JDs
   # Ensure no false positives/negatives
   ```

3. **PDF Integrity Check** (`script/check_pdfs.rb`)
   ```ruby
   # Verify all applications have PDFs on disk
   # Report orphaned PDFs or missing files
   ```

4. **Database Backup** (`script/backup_db.sh`)
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
   cp storage/development.sqlite3 ~/Backups/jobwizard_$DATE.sqlite3
   echo "Backed up to ~/Backups/jobwizard_$DATE.sqlite3"
   ```

## üìù Final Thoughts

JobWizard is a well-crafted Rails application that successfully leverages its local-only constraint for simplicity. The codebase is maintainable, follows Rails conventions, and implements sophisticated features (filtering, skill assessment, PDF generation) with clean service objects.

**Key Takeaway**: The biggest opportunity is to **lean into the local-only nature** even more:
- Remove unnecessary complexity (async jobs, deployment artifacts)
- Embrace filesystem as source of truth
- Add local-specific conveniences (Finder integration, launchd automation, macOS notifications)
- Focus on power-user features (bulk actions, keyboard shortcuts, templates)

The recommended changes prioritize:
1. **Fix critical bugs** (UUID migration)
2. **Reduce complexity** (consolidate PDF generation, remove async)
3. **Improve UX** (Open in Finder, bulk actions)
4. **Increase confidence** (more tests, validation)

With these improvements, JobWizard will be an even more powerful, maintainable, and delightful tool for your job search workflow.
