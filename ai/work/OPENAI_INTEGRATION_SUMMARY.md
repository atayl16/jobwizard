# OpenAI Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for AI-powered resume and cover letter generation in JobWizard. The integration is **opt-in**, **truth-only**, and **falls back gracefully** to template-based generation.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Step 1: Gem + Initializer

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `Gemfile` - Added `ruby-openai` gem
- `config/initializers/openai.rb` - OpenAI client configuration

**Features:**
- Memoized OpenAI client (`JobWizard.openai_client`)
- Returns `nil` safely if no API key present
- Configuration namespace: `Rails.application.config.job_wizard`
- Defaults:
  - Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
  - Temperature (resume): 0.5
  - Temperature (cover letter): 0.7
  - Max tokens: 800
- Auto-detects `AI_WRITER` env var based on API key presence

### ✅ Step 2: Writer Class

**Files Created:**
- `app/services/job_wizard/writers/open_ai_writer.rb`

**Features:**
- `OpenAiWriter#cover_letter(company:, role:, jd_text:, profile:, experience:)`
- `OpenAiWriter#resume_snippets(company:, role:, jd_text:, profile:, experience:)`
- Returns structured JSON: `{ content: "...", unverified_skills: [...] }`
- Enforces **truth-only** contract via system prompts
- Graceful error handling - returns error hash instead of raising
- JSON parsing with validation

**Truth-Only System Prompt Includes:**
- "MUST ONLY use facts from provided PROFILE and EXPERIENCE"
- "NEVER invent skills, projects, or achievements"
- "Add unverified skills to unverified_skills array"
- "Avoid buzzwords, be specific and human"

### ✅ Step 3: Factory Selection

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/job_wizard/writer_factory.rb`

**Logic:**
```ruby
if ENV['AI_WRITER'] == 'openai' && JobWizard.openai_client
  Writers::OpenAiWriter
else
  Writers::TemplatesWriter
end
```

Auto-defaults to OpenAI if API key present, otherwise templates.

### ✅ Step 4: Integration with Resume/Cover Workflow

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/job_wizard/resume_builder.rb`

**Features:**
- `#generate_cover_letter_text` - Tries AI writer, falls back to templates on error
- `#unverified_skills` - Exposes unverified skills from AI generation
- Loads YAML data and passes to writer
- Handles both AI (instance) and template (class method) writers

**Fallback Chain:**
```
OpenAI Generation → (on error) → Template Writer → (always succeeds)
```

### ✅ Step 5: Tests

**Files Created:**
- `spec/services/job_wizard/writers/openai_writer_spec.rb` (11 examples)
- `spec/integration/ai_truth_only_spec.rb` (6 examples)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Initialization with/without client
- ✅ Valid JSON responses
- ✅ Unverified skills extraction
- ✅ Malformed JSON handling
- ✅ API failure handling
- ✅ Truth-only system prompt verification
- ✅ End-to-end integration with ResumeBuilder
- ✅ Fallback to template writer

**All 17 AI-related tests pass!**

### ✅ Step 6: Rake Tasks (Manual Smoke Tests)

**Files Created:**
- `lib/tasks/ai_smoke.rake`

**Tasks:**
```bash
rake ai:cover_letter["Company","Role"]
rake ai:resume["Company","Role"]
```

**Features:**
- Only runs if `OPENAI_API_KEY` present
- Creates sample JD if missing
- Prints generated content to stdout
- Shows unverified skills
- Clear error messages

### ✅ Step 7: Config Flags & Documentation

**Files Created:**
- `docs/AI_WRITER_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- Sample `.env` configuration documented

**Files Modified:**
- `README.md` - Added AI generation section

**Documentation Includes:**
- Quick start guide
- Configuration options
- How it works (truth-only guarantee)
- Cost estimates (~$0.001 per application)
- Testing instructions
- Troubleshooting
- Privacy & security notes

### ✅ Step 8: Truth-Only Guardrails Tests

**Verified:**
- ✅ Unverified skills returned in response
- ✅ Unverified skills NOT included in generated text
- ✅ System prompt enforces truth-only rules
- ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end contract

### ✅ Step 9: UI - Unverified Skills Warning

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/job_wizard/application_pdf_generator.rb`
- `app/controllers/applications_controller.rb` (all PDF generation paths)

**Features:**
- Captures unverified skills from AI writer
- Stores in `Application#flags` JSON column
- Displays in `applications/show.html.erb` (already had UI support)
- Yellow warning banner shows: "These skills were NOT included in your generated resume"

### ✅ Step 10: Finish Line

**Status:**
- ✅ `bundle install` - Success
- ✅ All AI tests pass (17/17)
- ✅ Linter clean (no errors)
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Rake tasks functional
- ✅ UI integrated

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Opt-In?
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Works perfectly without API key
- No deployment complexity

### Why gpt-4o-mini?
- Excellent quality/cost ratio
- Fast generation (~1-2 seconds)
- Very low cost (~$0.001 per application)

### Why Truth-Only Contract?
- Maintains trust in generated content
- Never claims unverified skills
- Explicitly flags discrepancies

### Why Graceful Fallbacks?
- Never blocks user workflows
- Transparent degradation
- No error-induced downtime

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (11 examples)
- Mock OpenAI client responses
- Test all error paths
- Verify JSON parsing
- Confirm truth-only prompts

### Integration Tests (6 examples)
- End-to-end workflow
- Unverified skills handling
- Fallback behavior
- ResumeBuilder integration

### Manual Smoke Tests
- Rake tasks for real API testing
- Only when user has API key
- No network calls in automated tests

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for AI generation
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Optional (with defaults)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_TEMP_RESUME=0.5
OPENAI_TEMP_COVER_LETTER=0.7
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=800
AI_WRITER=openai  # or 'templates'
```

### Rails Configuration

```ruby
Rails.application.config.job_wizard.ai_enabled
Rails.application.config.job_wizard.openai_model
Rails.application.config.job_wizard.openai_temperature_resume
Rails.application.config.job_wizard.openai_temperature_cover_letter
Rails.application.config.job_wizard.openai_max_tokens
```

## Usage Examples

### Automatic (Transparent)

```ruby
# In any controller or service
builder = JobWizard::ResumeBuilder.new(job_description: jd)
cover_letter_pdf = builder.build_cover_letter  # Uses AI if key present
unverified = builder.unverified_skills  # Access unverified skills
```

### Explicit Writer Selection

```ruby
# Force templates
ENV['AI_WRITER'] = 'templates'
writer = JobWizard::WriterFactory.build  # => TemplatesWriter

# Force OpenAI (requires key)
ENV['AI_WRITER'] = 'openai'
writer = JobWizard::WriterFactory.build  # => OpenAiWriter or fallback to TemplatesWriter
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test cover letter generation
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
rake ai:cover_letter["Stripe","Senior Rails Engineer"]

# Test resume snippets
rake ai:resume["Google","Staff Engineer"]
```

## Cost Analysis

### Per Application
- Input: ~2,000 tokens (profile + experience + JD)
- Output: ~800 tokens (cover letter or resume)
- Cost with gpt-4o-mini: ~$0.001 (one-tenth of a cent)

### Monthly Estimates
- 10 applications/month: ~$0.01
- 50 applications/month: ~$0.05
- 100 applications/month: ~$0.10

**Conclusion:** Extremely affordable for personal use.

## Error Handling

### Network Failures
```ruby
result = writer.cover_letter(...)
if result[:error]
  # Falls back to template writer automatically
end
```

### Malformed JSON
- Caught and logged
- Returns error hash
- Triggers fallback

### Missing API Key
- Returns `nil` client
- Factory selects TemplatesWriter
- No errors, no warnings (unless explicitly requested)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not yet implemented):

1. **Streaming Responses** - Real-time generation feedback
2. **Response Caching** - Cache commonly-used profile+experience combinations
3. **Custom Prompts** - User-defined system prompts
4. **A/B Testing** - Compare temperatures/models
5. **Other Providers** - Anthropic Claude, local models
6. **Batch Generation** - Optimize multiple applications at once
